I can't get this to work on Heroku any more and I don't know why. It was working two hours ago. I'm not a Heroku expert.

I tried reverting to a commit which I knew worked, and while the application launches now, it immediately returns an SQL error and I don't know why. I'm not a SQL expert.

Reverting did achieve one thing, however. I deleted two hours' worth of work, completely by accident. I'm not a git expert.

If I sound frustrated, it's because I am. This whole thing has been a nightmare from start to finish.

If you're reviewing this project, I'm sorry. You'll probably have to download it and run it on your own computer. At least it works on mine. Good luck.

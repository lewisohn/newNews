After reading, they may notice the list of categories the article is filed under. Clicking a category will show them other articles filed under the same category, which they can click to read.

## Case 2

An author wants to create a new article. They visit the website and access the control panel, where they will find a button that reads **+ New article**. Clicking it takes them to the creation page. They must fill out all the fields and attach an image in JPEG or PNG format. Clicking **Submit** will publish the article immediately and take them back to the control panel.

## Case 3

An editor wants to edit an article. They visit the website and access the control panel. After locating the article they want to edit, they click the corresponding link labelled **Edit**. They will find a form similar to the "new article" page, except pre-filled with the article's content. They can make the changes they desire. Should they wish to upload a new image for the article, they can do so; if they don't, the existing image, which is shown on the editing page, is preserved. Once they are satisfied, they can click the **Submit** button, which will save the changes (assuming they are valid) and take them back to the control panel.

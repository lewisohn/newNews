# Specification

The aim is to create a news website and backend, where news articles can be read, created, edited, deleted, and so on. Articles must have headlines, standfirsts, images, bodies and publication dates. Additionally, they must have at least one author and at least one category.

It should be possible to list articles by their publication date (newest first) and the number of views they've received in the past week (most popular first). The home page should list the five newest articles and show their headlines, standfirst and images. Clicking on the article should let the user read it in full. Other lists should show the headline and publication date, which also function as links to the article.

Every page should also include a list of the newest and most popular articles. The top of the website should show the categories.
